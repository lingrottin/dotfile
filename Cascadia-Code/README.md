# Cascadia Code
These files are [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) (and its Nerd Font patch) from Microsoft, patched with [pyftfeatfreezer](https://github.com/twardoch/fonttools-opentype-feature-freezer/) with `ss01` feature enabled ( there will be a slash instead of a dot in `0` after patching).
